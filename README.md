Hello, beifuss here. 
I love analitical philosophy and especialy Ludwig Wittgenstein. 
I think he is one of the greatest philosophers, his conceptions of language
are so beautiful, but his life is more interest that his ideas. 
This website is not adaptive yet, cause i have a lot of ideas i need to make 
for practicing my skillset of programming...
